## Directory App
For clubs, classes, churches, etc.

I began developing this directory app for [Coursera's Full Stack Web Development Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/full-stack) using Mongo, Express, Angular and Node, along with Bootstrap.

To install, clone the repository, install the dependencies with npm, install and run [Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=nav#community) locally and open `localhost:3000` in the browser and it should work. There is a little data (`some-data.json`) that conforms to the schema to get you started.

TODO (as of December 23, 2017)
- Protect /add and /update views from users who have/haven't filled out membership data
- Get Address Line 2 to show up on detail view
- Handle phone and text buttons
- Enable photo uploading
- Enable record-by-record scanning in detail-view
- Expand schema to group members by household rather than only by individual
