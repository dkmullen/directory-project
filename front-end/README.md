## Directory App
For clubs, classes, churches, etc.

I'm developing this directy app for [Coursera's Full Stack Web Development Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/full-stack) using Mongo, Express, Angular and Node.

As of May 10, 2017, it is a functional, responsive web app that allows a user to add records to and retrieve records from the database. See TODO section below.

To install, clone the repository, install the dependencies with npm, install and run [Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=nav#community) locally and open `localhost:3000` in the browser and it should work. There is a little data (`some-data.json`) that conforms to the schema to get you started.

TODO (as of June 5, 2017)
- Finish login / sign-up procedures
- Fix date-field on forms in iOS
- Enable photo uploading
- Expand schema to group members by household rather than only by individual
