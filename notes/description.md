## Two-sentence project description
I plan to build a directory app that can be used by churches, clubs and other organizations to introduce and connect members. The app should allow members to upload photos of themselves along with contact information, and view the same for other members.

## Explanation
The photo directory is a staple for churches, clubs and other organizations. Modern directories from professional photography companies include an online element but these are generally tightly controlled by the photography company and users often can't update their picture or information. Other products in this space are either complex (too many features), expensive (requiring churches or groups to subscribe) or (sometimes) poorly designed and implemented. There might be an opportunity for a new and better product.

## Features
I plan to build a directory app with the following features:
- Users can upload, modify and delete their own photos, personal info and contact info
- Administrators can do the same for any user
- Photos can be set to require admin approval before posting
- Users can browse the directory by picture or by names of members
- Users can view a single 'page' containing a member's picture and contact info
- Users can click on contact links (phone numbers, email, social media links, etc.) which will open the appropriate app
- Only registered users can use the app
- Administrators can set registration to be 'human-approved' (which is usually the most appropriate way for a private organization) or auto-approved.
- Directory can be printed in an attractive format

## Similar products
- **Lifetouch** is a photography company that creates directories for schools, churches, etc. and offers an app where the information is mostly static. Contact information can be updated by an admin, but not by users, and pictures cannot be updated (lifetouch.com).
- **Directory Spot** is a promising alternative which offers user-updatability but not photos (directoryspot.net).
- **Instant Church Directory** is a many-featured service that allows users to upload photos but maybe not their contact info.
- **CTRN Online Directory** seems to have most of the features I'm looking for (onlinechurchdirectory.com).

## Benefits
End-users will be able to get to know others in the group/community/church by browsing faces and looking up contact information on other members.
